## About

This template is designed to be an easy method of creating and maintaining a course website. You can view the site [here](https://gunjanbaid.github.io/easy-course-webpage/). There is also an approximate screenshot attached below, in case the site is rendering weirdly on some browsers.

## How to use this template for your course website:

1. Add the `index.html` file into the gh-pages branch of your desired repository. 
1. Copy the google doc [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1heupis9Z-QW6DWI_84KfLSdLvScpscct0Ax_VcGm02Y/edit#heading=h.vapfrlrurseo) into your personal account (`File` -> `Make a copy`).
1. Edit your copy of the google doc and then publish it (`File` -> `Publish to the web`) -> click `Publish` on the `Link` tab. 
1. Copy the published document link and paste into the `index.html` page, replacing the link that is present.

## Other Information

If you have any trouble using the template, please open an issue or send me an email.

Please note, due to the nature of embedded google docs, some links will only work if opened in a new tab. If a link is not loading, please try opening it in a new tab. If you know how to fix this, please let me know by opening an issue. Thanks!
