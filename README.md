How to use this template for your course website:

1. Add the `index.html` file into the gh-pages branch of your desired repository. 
1. Copy the google doc [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1heupis9Z-QW6DWI_84KfLSdLvScpscct0Ax_VcGm02Y/edit#heading=h.vapfrlrurseo) into your personal account (`File` -> `Make a copy`).
1. Edit your copy of the google doc and then publish it (`File` -> `Publish to the web`) -> click `Publish` on the `Link` tab. 
1. Copy the published document link and paste into the `index.html` page, replacing the link that is present.

If you have any trouble using the template, please open an issue or send me an email at <span class="rev">ude.yelekreb@diab_najnug</span>.

<style type="text/css">
	span.rev {
    	unicode-bidi: bidi-override;
    	direction: rtl;
	}
</style>

Please note, due to the nature of embedded google docs, some links will only work if opened in a new tab. If a link is not loading, please try opening it in a new tab. If you know how to fix this, please let me know by opening an issue. Thanks!
